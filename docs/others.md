## Macintosh notes:

GSAS-II can be run on Windows, Linux and Macintosh/OS X computers, but the GUI follows the native style of Mac OS X. On Windows and some versions of Linux, the menu bars appears on top of the main window. On the Mac, the menu appears at the location that has been configured for menus (usually at the top of the screen). GSAS-II defines actions for both the left and right buttons on a two-button mouse, If a two or three-button mouse is used with a Mac, these mouse buttons will work as intended. If using a Mac touchpad or single-button mouse, clicking the touchpad or mouse button will generate a "left button" click. Hold down the control-key to generate a "right button" click.

## Configuration Variables:

GSAS-II provides a number of configuration settings that can be changed via variables that can be set and saved. These are controlled in the File/Preferences menu item (on Mac the Preferences menu is found in the usual place on Macs, in the main application menu). These settings are optionally saved from for subsequent runs in a file named config.py. More information about this can be found in the appropriate section of the Programmer's documentation.

## Programmers' documentation

The routines and classes used within GSAS-II are documented in a set of web pages and in a PDF document. This documentation is created from the Python source code files using Sphinx.
